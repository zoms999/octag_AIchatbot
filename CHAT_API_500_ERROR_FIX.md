# Chat API 500 Internal Server Error - Fix Documentation

## Problem Analysis

The `/api/chat/question` endpoint was returning a 500 Internal Server Error when processing chat requests. The error was caused by incorrect database session management in the FastAPI dependency injection system.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the `database/connection.py` file where the `get_async_session()` function was implemented as an async generator that yielded a session, but the FastAPI endpoints were trying to use it as an async context manager with `async with` syntax.

### Original Problematic Code:
```python
async def get_async_session() -> AsyncGenerator[AsyncSession, None]:
    """Get async database session"""
    async with db_manager.get_async_session() as session:
        yield session
```

### Error Encountered:
```
TypeError: 'async_generator' object does not support the asynchronous context manager protocol
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Database Session Function
Updated `database/connection.py` to return a session directly instead of yielding it:

```python
async def get_async_session() -> AsyncSession:
    """Get async database session"""
    session_factory = db_manager.get_async_session_factory()
    return session_factory()
```

### 2. Updated Chat Endpoints
Modified `api/chat_endpoints.py` to properly handle database sessions:

- Removed `db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_async_session)` from endpoint parameters
- Added proper session management using `async with db_manager.get_async_session() as db:`
- Updated RAG component initialization to work with the new session management

### 3. Key Changes Made:

#### In `get_rag_components()`:
- Removed database dependency from the function signature
- Simplified to only return components that don't need database sessions
- Database-dependent components are now initialized within endpoints

#### In `ask_question()` endpoint:
- Wrapped database operations in proper async context manager
- Initialize database-dependent RAG components within the session context
- Proper session lifecycle management

#### In other endpoints:
- Applied the same session management pattern to:
  - `submit_feedback()`
  - `get_conversation_history()`
  - `websocket_endpoint()`
  - `health_check()`

## Files Modified

1. **database/connection.py** - Fixed session function
2. **api/chat_endpoints.py** - Updated all endpoints to use proper session management
3. **test_chat_endpoint.py** - Updated test script to use corrected session handling

## Testing

The fix was verified by:
1. Testing individual components to identify the specific error
2. Making the necessary corrections to session management
3. Testing the API endpoint to confirm the 500 error was resolved

## Impact

- ✅ Chat API endpoints now work correctly
- ✅ Database sessions are properly managed and closed
- ✅ No memory leaks from unclosed sessions
- ✅ Proper error handling maintained
- ✅ All RAG pipeline components function correctly

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always test database session management when using FastAPI dependencies
2. Ensure async context managers are used correctly with database sessions
3. Verify that dependency injection patterns match the actual function signatures
4. Test endpoints individually when debugging complex dependency chains

## Related Components

The fix affects the entire RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline:
- Question processing
- Document retrieval
- Context building
- Response generation
- Conversation storage

All components now work correctly with the fixed session management.
